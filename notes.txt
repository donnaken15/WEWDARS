    NOTES:

    This is an installer like script designed for power users and super users (like me),
    and is recommended to be used on a computer that solely belongs to you, or has only
    one user profile available on it.
    
    This script has only been tested on a Windows 10 64-bit/AtlasOS virtual machine.
    
    It's also recommended you do this on a fresh install or with no files present
    that could be effected (even when humanely checked to be safe) if you plan
    to run TronScript.
